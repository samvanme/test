## Context

### Last Action
Phase 5-01.1 planned (Demo UI Refinements). 5 tasks:
- Custom scrollbar styling (dark, thin, brutalist)
- Bottom-anchored chat layout
- Avatar icons for agents/callers
- Rotating tool call scenarios
- Build/lint verification

### Next Action
Execute Phase 5-01.1:
```bash
/gsd:execute-plan 05-01.1
```

After 5-01.1, plan Phase 5-02 (Backend Integration) or skip to Phase 6.

### Blockers
None

### Decisions Made
- Phone numbers centralized in `src/constants/config.js`
- Base URL configurable via VITE_BASE_URL environment variable
- Footer links converted to non-interactive (pages don't exist yet)
- ESLint scoped to src/ for React rules
- **Typography**: Darker Grotesque (display), Space Grotesk (body), IBM Plex Mono (code)
- **Shadow system**: Hard offset shadows, no blur
- **Color restraint**: Brand blue on CTAs only
- **Animation policy**: Functional motion only (waveform, ping kept; aurora, float removed)
- **Layout approach**: Left-aligned asymmetric (not centered)
- **Section numbers**: Use numbered prefixes (01, 02...) for section headers
- **Agent differentiation**: Revenue = blue accent, Service = white accent
- **FinalCTA**: Kept centered layout (appropriate for CTA sections)
- **Footer**: Simplified links, solid white logo (no gradient)
- **Animation components**: CSS-first approach to avoid React state complexity
- **Reduced motion**: All animations respect prefers-reduced-motion with static fallbacks
- **Demo architecture**: State machine with useDemoState hook, dependency injection for connection

### Decisions Pending
- AI backend choice for Phase 5-02 (requires research)
- WebSocket vs polling for real-time updates
- Voice API integration (Web Speech API vs cloud service)
- Form submission handling for Phase 6 (serverless vs CRM)
