## Context

### Last Action
Phase 2 Design System completed with 15 commits. Implemented brutalist design tokens, typography (Darker Grotesque, Space Grotesk, IBM Plex Mono), shadow system, and refactored all major components.

### Next Action
Execute Phase 3: Section Redesign
- Run `/gsd:execute-plan` to begin execution
- Plan: `.planning/phases/03-section-redesign/03-01-PLAN.md`
- 12 tasks covering all section layouts

### Blockers
None

### Decisions Made
- Phone numbers centralized in `src/constants/config.js`
- Base URL configurable via VITE_BASE_URL environment variable
- Footer links converted to non-interactive (pages don't exist yet)
- ESLint scoped to src/ for React rules
- **Typography**: Darker Grotesque (display), Space Grotesk (body), IBM Plex Mono (code)
- **Shadow system**: Hard offset shadows, no blur
- **Color restraint**: Brand blue on CTAs only
- **Animation policy**: Functional motion only (waveform, ping kept; aurora, float removed)

### Decisions Pending
- AI backend choice for Phase 5 (requires research)
- Form submission handling for Phase 6 (serverless vs CRM)

### Session History
- 2026-01-11: Phase 1 executed (8 tasks, 7 commits)
- 2026-01-12: Phase 2 executed (16 tasks, 15 commits)
