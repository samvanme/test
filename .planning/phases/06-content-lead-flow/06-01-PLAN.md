# Plan 06-01: Content Messaging & Lead Form UI

## Objective

Implement partner differentiation messaging throughout the site and build consultation form UI for lead capture. This plan focuses on content updates and UI components; backend form handling deferred to 06-02.

## Context

**Current State:**
- Hero: Generic "AI That Works Inside Your CRM" messaging
- CTAs: Phone calls only, no form-based lead capture
- UseCases: Shows phases but lacks partner positioning
- HowItWorks: Process focused, not relationship focused
- FinalCTA: Simple phone CTA, no consultation form
- No industry vertical differentiation

**Target State:**
- Clear partner vs vendor differentiation messaging
- End-to-end solution narrative (strategy → production)
- Industry vertical capability showcase
- Consultation form with progressive disclosure
- Clear CTAs with multiple contact options

**Design Decisions:**
- Brutalist form styling: thick borders, hard shadows, no rounded corners
- Form as progressive disclosure: starts minimal, expands based on interest
- Partner messaging: emphasize "we build WITH you" not "we sell TO you"
- Industry verticals: unified in UseCases, not separate pages
- Mock submission initially (console.log + success state)

## Tasks

### T1: Update Hero with Partner Messaging
**Type:** feat
**Files:** `src/components/Hero.jsx`

Update Hero section messaging to emphasize partnership positioning:
- Change overline from "Production AI Systems" to "AI Integration Partner"
- Update subheadline to emphasize building together, not just selling
- Add trust indicator: "Strategy → Design → Production → Support"
- Keep existing CTA buttons but update secondary CTA text

**Verification:**
- Hero clearly positions StrataBlue as a partner, not vendor
- Typography and styling remain consistent with design system
- Responsive layout preserved

---

### T2: Enhance HowItWorks with End-to-End Narrative
**Type:** feat
**Files:** `src/components/HowItWorks.jsx`

Strengthen the end-to-end solution narrative:
- Add "04 - Support" step to show ongoing relationship
- Update step descriptions to emphasize collaboration
- Add tagline: "From strategy through production—and beyond"
- Ensure step cards work with 4 columns on desktop (2x2 grid or horizontal)

**Verification:**
- All 4 steps render correctly on mobile, tablet, desktop
- Narrative flows: Discover → Design → Deploy → Support
- Partner relationship emphasis clear

---

### T3: Add Industry Verticals to UseCases
**Type:** feat
**Files:** `src/components/UseCases.jsx`

Enhance UseCases with industry vertical indicators:
- Add industry badges to each use case (e.g., "Healthcare", "Finance", "Professional Services")
- Add "Industries we serve" subheading or row below cards
- Keep unified layout (no separate pages per industry)
- Industries: Healthcare, Finance, Professional Services, Real Estate, Legal

**Verification:**
- Industry verticals visible without cluttering cards
- Maintains brutalist aesthetic
- Responsive layout preserved

---

### T4: Create ConsultationForm Component
**Type:** feat
**Files:** `src/components/ConsultationForm.jsx` (new)

Build consultation form UI with progressive disclosure:
- Initial state: Name, Email, Company fields + "What's your biggest challenge?" textarea
- Submit button with brutalist styling (thick border, hard shadow)
- Success state: Thank you message with expected response time
- Error state: Validation messages (required fields)
- Mock submission: console.log form data + show success state

Form structure:
```
Name: [required]
Email: [required, email format]
Company: [optional]
Challenge: [textarea, required]
[Submit: "Start Conversation"]
```

**Verification:**
- Form renders with brutalist styling (matches design system)
- Validation works for required fields
- Submit logs to console and shows success state
- Responsive on all breakpoints

---

### T5: Integrate Form into FinalCTA Section
**Type:** feat
**Files:** `src/components/FinalCTA.jsx`

Replace or augment FinalCTA with consultation form:
- Keep phone CTA as primary option
- Add form below as secondary "or start here" option
- Layout: centered, form max-width ~500px
- Add section divider: "— or start a conversation —"

**Verification:**
- Phone CTA remains prominent
- Form provides alternative path for those who prefer async
- Layout balanced and not overwhelming
- Responsive across breakpoints

---

### T6: Refine CTAs Across Sections
**Type:** refactor
**Files:** `src/components/Hero.jsx`, `src/components/HowItWorks.jsx`, `src/components/UseCases.jsx`

Update CTA language and links for consistency:
- Hero secondary: "See Demo" → "Watch It Work"
- HowItWorks CTA: "Schedule Fit Check Call" → "Book Discovery Call"
- UseCases links: "Learn More" → "Explore This System" (links to #book)
- Ensure all booking CTAs link to #book section

**Verification:**
- CTA language consistent and action-oriented
- All booking links navigate to #book section
- Phone and form options clear

---

### T7: Add Form State Management Hook
**Type:** feat
**Files:** `src/hooks/useFormState.js` (new)

Create reusable form state hook for ConsultationForm:
- Manages field values, validation, submission state
- Returns: values, errors, isSubmitting, isSuccess, handleChange, handleSubmit
- Validation: required fields, email format
- Mock submit: 1s delay then success

**Verification:**
- Hook properly manages form lifecycle
- Validation messages appear for invalid fields
- Success state resets form or shows thank you

## Verification

After all tasks:
1. Run `npm run build` - no errors
2. Run `npm run lint` - no errors
3. Visual check: Hero → UseCases → HowItWorks → FinalCTA flow
4. Test form: validation, submit, success state
5. Test responsive: mobile, tablet, desktop

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Hero messaging emphasizes partnership positioning
- [ ] HowItWorks shows full lifecycle (4 steps)
- [ ] UseCases includes industry vertical indicators
- [ ] ConsultationForm component works with mock submission
- [ ] FinalCTA includes both phone and form options
- [ ] CTAs consistent and link to appropriate sections
- [ ] All changes pass build and lint
- [ ] Responsive layout preserved throughout

## Output

- Updated Hero, HowItWorks, UseCases, FinalCTA components
- New ConsultationForm component
- New useFormState hook
- 7 commits (one per task)
- Ready for 06-02 backend integration

## Notes

**Pending Decision (06-02):**
Form submission handling options:
1. Serverless function (Netlify/Vercel) → Email notification
2. Direct CRM integration (HubSpot, Salesforce)
3. Form service (Formspree, Basin)

Current plan uses mock submission; 06-02 will implement real backend.
