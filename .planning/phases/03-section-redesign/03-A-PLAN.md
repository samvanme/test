# Plan 03-A: Hero & VoiceDemo Redesign

## Overview

Redesign the Hero and VoiceDemo sections to achieve a bolder, more impactful brutalist aesthetic. Focus on typography-forward design, stripped-down layouts, and clearer visual hierarchy.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Simplify Hero headline structure
**Goal**: Create maximum impact with fewer elements
- Remove duplicated stats row (stats section exists separately)
- Simplify the overline badge styling
- Make headline more concise and punchy
- Strengthen the subheadline messaging

### Task 2: Bold Hero typography and layout
**Goal**: Typography-first visual hierarchy
- Use display-xl for maximum headline impact
- Remove soft gradients (use stark backgrounds only)
- Add asymmetric layout option for visual interest
- Apply thick border accents strategically

### Task 3: Redesign Hero CTA section
**Goal**: Clear action hierarchy with brutalist styling
- Primary CTA: High contrast with shadow-brutal
- Secondary CTA: Ghost style with thick border
- Add visual breathing room
- Trust indicators as simple text, not checkmarks

### Task 4: Refactor VoiceDemo section header
**Goal**: Consistent brutalist section intro
- Bold section header with asymmetric positioning
- Remove soft radial gradient background
- Add grid-based layout structure
- Improve spacing rhythm

### Task 5: Redesign VoiceDemo agent cards
**Goal**: Cleaner, more distinctive card styling
- Simplify card structure (reduce nesting)
- Use brutalist card styling (thick borders, hard shadows)
- Differentiate agents visually (Revenue = blue accent, Service = white accent)
- Improve waveform visualization container

### Task 6: Enhance VoiceDemo interactivity styling
**Goal**: Clear interactive affordances
- Improve play button styling with hover states
- Add clearer progress/duration indicator
- Style metric badges consistently
- Better visual feedback on hover

### Task 7: Responsive improvements for Hero
**Goal**: Excellent mobile experience
- Stack CTAs vertically on mobile
- Adjust typography scale for small screens
- Ensure touch targets meet accessibility guidelines (44x44px)
- Test spacing at all breakpoints

### Task 8: Responsive improvements for VoiceDemo
**Goal**: Excellent mobile experience
- Single column layout on mobile
- Card spacing adjustments
- Touch-friendly waveform/play controls
- Section padding optimization
