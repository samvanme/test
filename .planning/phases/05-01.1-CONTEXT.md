# Phase 5-01.1: Demo UI Refinements — Context

## Vision

Quick refinement pass on the demo UI from Phase 5-01. The core architecture is solid, but the visual presentation needs polish to match the brutalist aesthetic and feel more like a native chat experience.

## How It Works

### Scrollbar Styling
The current browser-default scrollbars look out of place in the dark, brutalist cards. Scrollbars should be styled to match:
- Dark theme (matches card background)
- Thin/minimal profile
- Fits the brutalist aesthetic established in Phase 2

### Bottom-Anchored Chat Flow
Messages currently fill from top-down. Should behave like modern chat:
- New messages appear at bottom
- Conversation drifts upward as it grows
- Most recent exchange is always visible without scrolling
- Older messages scroll up and out of view

### Avatar Icons
Add participant identification with minimalist, post-modern icons:
- **Agents** (Alex AI, Sarah AI): Bot/AI icon
- **Callers**: User/person icon
- **Color-coded**: Revenue side = blue accent, Service side = white accent
- Style: Minimalist, post-modern (not cartoon, not photorealistic)

## What's Essential

1. Scrollbars don't break the visual design
2. Chat feels natural (bottom-anchored like real messaging)
3. Clear visual distinction between agent and caller in transcript

## What's Out of Scope

- Backend integration (Phase 5-02)
- New demo functionality or flows
- Layout restructuring (keeping two side-by-side cards)
- Real voice/AI integration

## Design Constraints

- Must maintain Revenue (blue) vs Service (white) differentiation
- Must respect existing brutalist design tokens (shadows, borders, typography)
- Must work with reduced-motion preferences
